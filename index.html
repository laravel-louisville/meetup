<p>You spent your entire day in front of a computer making things. Come out and join some other humans in Louisville who do the same thing. We're a group of web developers and PHP programmers who enjoy building software with the Laravel framework. The goal of Laravel Louisville is to help build the software engineering community in Louisville by teaching each other how to write quality software in PHP.</p>
